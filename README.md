Team:
- Bob adds his courses. For each course he adds the assignments and their weightings and due dates. He can add or delete assignments and change their information (weight and due date). He can delete courses. 

Miral:
- (IF GOOGLE CALENDAR API IS AVAILABLE) A google calendar event is created for each assignment. The notification on this event is dependent on how heavy the weight is.
- (IF GOOGLE CALENDAR API IS NOT AVAILABLE) Bob gets a notification email before his assignment is due depending on the weight (a larger assignment has an earlier notification)

Alisha:
- Bob updates his grade for an assignment. This new grade is stored. His final grade is calculated and stored. His grade breakdown is displayed given this new information. He gets a regrade and is able to change his grade and get the new breakdown.

Nada:
- Bob wants to check what his final grade would be hypothetically if he got a specific mark on the next assignment. He enters a hypothetical mark for a set assignment and the program returns his hypothetical final grade. This hypothetical mark and final grade are not stored in his account. When he logs out this information is deleted (goes back to his actual grades)
