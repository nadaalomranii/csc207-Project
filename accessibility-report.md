   If you do not have any such features, you can either:
   (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
   (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
   This application targets university and college students who need a streamlined way to manage their academic responsibilities. These students often juggle multiple classes and assignments, making effective time management a crucial skill. The program is particularly appealing to those who prefer digital solutions for tracking due dates and grades. Additionally, it is especially beneficial for first-year students transitioning from high school, as it helps them stay organized in a more demanding academic environment. The integration of automatic reminders to begin assignments further enhances its appeal, particularly for students seeking to improve their time management skills.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
   Certain demographics may find this program less accessible due to design assumptions that might not fully consider the diverse needs of all users. For instance, users with disabilities, such as visual impairments or cognitive challenges, might find it difficult to navigate the program due to the lack of features like text-to-speech, high-contrast modes, or simplified user interfaces​. Additionally, elderly users might face challenges due to the smaller text sizes and the lack of tutorials, which could unintentionally exclude them from benefiting from the tool​. Following the principles of universal design, such as equitable and flexible use, can mitigate these issues and help the program appeal to a broader audience. Therefore, expanding accessibility features would help ensure inclusivity and prevent both tangible and relational harm.
